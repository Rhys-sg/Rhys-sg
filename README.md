# About Me
My name is Rhys Sorenson-Graff, and I am a Senior at Whitman College, studying Human-Computer Interaction and Design. I have worked with faculty and administrators to introduce this course of study at Whitman. My recent projects include working with the Walla Walla Valley Disability Network to improve their “parent-to-parent” communication systems, creating a haptic feedback navigation system for blind users, and an app for rock climbers to improve their training programs. This semester, I am teaching a credited course combining two of my passions: rock climbing and design at Whitman.
