# About Me:
My name is Rhys Sorenson-Graff, and I am a Junior at Whitman College, studying Human-Computer Interaction and Design. I am the first Whitman student to study a design major and have been working with faculty and administrators to bring design to Whitman College. Starting next year, I will teach one credited design course at Whitman and assist with another. My recent projects include working with the Walla Walla Valley Disability Network to improve their ‚Äúparent-to-parent‚Äù communication systems, creating a haptic feedback navigation system for blind users, and an app for rock climbers to improve their training programs.
